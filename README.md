## ARCHITECTURE

    The architecture of Controllers, Entities, Services, and Repository is commonly associated with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. MVC is a design pattern that separates the concerns of an application into three interconnected components

    - Controllers: Controllers are components in software architectures that handle user interactions and manage the flow of data between the user interface and other parts of the system. 

    - Entities: Entities refer to the objects or concepts that are relevant to the business or problem domain of a software application.

    - Services:  Services are components in software architectures that encapsulate business logic or application-specific functionality.

    - Repository: JPA interfaces - Repositories are components that handle the persistence and retrieval of data from a storage mechanism, such as a database or file system.
